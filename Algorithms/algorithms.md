### Linear & Binary Search
- **Linear Search**: *searching an array by comparing its values 1-by-1 to the target value, usually by beginning at the left/start and advancing to the right/end until the target value is found or you can conclude it doesn't exist.*
- **Binary search**: *searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.*
  1. Begin with an interval covering the entire array.
  2. If the target value is less than the middle item, narrow the interval to the lower half (or to the upper half is greater than).
  3. Repeat halving process until target value is found or the interval is empty.
     - Time Complexity: **O(logâ€¢n)**
