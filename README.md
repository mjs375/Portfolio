### About Me:
- I am currently a public reference / Digital Resources librarian in **```New Jersey```** who is interested in branching out to the programming field. My formal experience includes courses during my **```Rutgers University```** graduate program, an [internship](https://digitalthoreau.org/team/) at Milne Library (**```SUNY Geneseo```**) that included proofreading & editing XML code for the *[Digital Thoreau](https://digitalthoreau.org/)* project, and finally, ongoing, self-directed coursework from Harvard's **```CS50 series```**. For some fun learning I do online programming practice, e.g. **```Codewars```** and miscellaneous solo projects, such as forays into Webscraping and game design.
  - Email: *spitzer.matthewjames@gmail.com*
  - Résumé: *on request*
- This repository was made to document my growth in programming expertise, as well as simply define and link to resources for various languages & tools for new programmers. The chart below is simply a rough outline of my own experience, the skill levels are all relative between Beginner to Intermediate. Many exercises & projects are housed here, though larger projects are in other repositories that you may need to request permission to see/collaborate on. *Note: the 'Tutorials' folder often contains near-verbatim, personal notes taken from online sources (cited within), they are not my own and are merely for study/practice purposes.*

- The following table is no longer up-to-date, but does showcase the breadth of my learning when I was just beginning programming in 2020-21, and served as a to-do list of sorts to myself, to train more in specific areas, and add new skills.
